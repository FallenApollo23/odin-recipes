    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>When I was young I had never had good pork. It was always overdone and underseasoned. Now, I didn't know this at the time, I just thought that was how 
            pork was supposed to be. This is the first pork recipe I made on my own and good lord is it one of the best dishes I have ever made. This dish literally 
            changed my entire view on pork being a viable meal. Something that is not only amazingly good but also surprisingly cheap! Without further ado, let's 
            get into it.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2-&frac12 to 3 pound boneless pork roast, pork sirloin</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>For the rub:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <p><li>2 to 3 teaspoons fresh garlic, <em>pressed or finely minced</em></li></p>
                <p><li>1-&frac12 teaspoons kosher salt</li></p>
                <p><li>&frac34 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li></p>
                <p><li>1-&frac12 teaspoons fresh sage leaves, <em>finely chopped</em></li></p>
                <p><li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, <em>finely chopped</em></li></p>
                <p><li>2 teaspoons freshly grated orange zest</li></p>
            </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the roast from the regerator 30 minutes ahead of time to bring it to room termperature.</li>
            <p><li>Preheat the oven to 350&#8457.</li></p>
            <p><li>Make the rub by combining the olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, sage, rosemary, thyme, and orang zest in a small bowl.</li></p>
            <p><li>Using your hands, coat the roast completely with the prepared rub.</li></p>
            <p><li>Place on a rack in a roasting pan and pour &frac12-inch of water into the bottom of the pan (this creates moist heat)</li></p>
            <p><li>Roast the pork until a thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers between 140&#8457 and 145&#8457, 50 to 60 minutes
                (see notes).</li></p>
            <p><li>Remove from the oven, tent loosely with foil, and allow the roast to rest for 15 minutes before carving.</li></p>
            <p><li>Slice and serve on a platter garnished with sprigs of fresh herbs.</li></p>
        </ol>
